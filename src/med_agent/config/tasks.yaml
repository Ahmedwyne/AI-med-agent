tasks:
  - agent_id: pubmed_search
    description: Search PubMed for PMIDs matching the user's question.
    expected_output: A comma-separated string of PubMed IDs.

  - agent_id: fetch_abstracts
    description: Fetch abstracts for the given PMIDs from PubMed.
    expected_output: Raw abstract text concatenated by double newlines.

  - agent_id: drug_info
    description: Retrieve key drug data if the user's query pertains to a medication.
    expected_output: A humanâ€‘readable summary of drug properties.

  - agent_id: embed_and_index
    description: Embed the retrieved abstracts (and optionally drug info) and index them in ChromaDB.
    expected_output: Status and number of chunks indexed.

  - agent_id: retrieve_chunks
    description: Retrieve up to the top 3 semantically relevant text chunks for the query.
    expected_output: A list of text chunks.

  - agent_id: generate_summary
    description: Generate the final medical answer using Groq's LLaMA model. The answer must synthesize and directly address the user's medical question using the extracted findings from the fetched abstracts and drug information. All key claims and recommendations should be supported by evidence from the studies, with in-text PMID citations. At the end, provide a reference list of all PMIDs used.
    expected_output: A concise, safe, and evidence-based answer to the user's medical question, with in-text PMID citations and a reference list of PMIDs.
